guide RNA prediction pipeline from WGS short read data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
	- a Unix environment with grep etc. available 
	- Python 2.7 or higher
	- EMBOSS bioinformatics package; including WATER (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/download/)
	- pullseq (https://github.com/bcthomas/pullseq)
	
	- JBrowse (optional) (http://jbrowse.org/)
	- gnu paralell

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a suite of scripts for predicting guide RNAs from Illumnina type 
short read data. This pipeline is not prescriptive; it is possible to get the same results by doing
things in a different order/using different programmes that do the same thing. 

This is a multi-step and modular process and is designed so that the output can be viewed
in JBrowse genome viewer; the final output file is a modified GFF3 file and 
can easily be parsed into any desired format to suit your visualisation/
analysis requirements i.e. GBrowse/Artemis. 

As this is process is designed to analysis mitochondrial reads from Kinetoplastids
any WGS data can be first mapped to a reference genome (if one is available) 
and reads that map can be discarded. This step is optional but will reduce computation 
time significantly.

Duplicate reads can also be collapsed and fasta headers must be replaced so that
they are in the format >SEQ_ID.

Low complexity reads can also be removed at this stage (i.e. reads with long homo-nucleotide tracts).
A script is provided to remove reads which are more than 80% T/N/C. Poly N tracts must be removed. 

As a general rule fasta sequences are easier to handle as one line; a script has been provided to convert 
multi-line fastas to 1 line. 

The majority of these steps can easily be paralellised using GNU paralell 

PIPELINE OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: Smith-Waterman alignments of collapsed and renamed reads to Pre-Edited mRNA.


This aligns each read to the pre-edited mRNA using a the modified alignment matrix (provided).
Generates a file with reads that match to the pre-edited mRNA labelled with a '#'.
a)
water_to_PreEdited.sh QUERIES.fa | filter_pre_edited.py | grep -v '#' | awk '{print $1}' > do_not_match_pre_ed.hdr 

These reads can be discarded and the headers for the reads that do not match extracted.  
b)
pullseq -i QUERIES.fa -n do_not_match_pre_ed.hdr | fasta_1line > no_pre_ed.fa 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: Smith-Waterman alignments of reads that do not align to pre-edited maxicircles
to the edited sequences. 

water_to_EDITED.sh no_pre_ed.fa | filter_edited.py | grep -v '#|@' > match_edited.gff

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: Permutation test of reads that align to edited maxicircle mRNA 
  
Reads that matched well to the edited maxicircle mRNA must be tested for statistical significance

a) first extract the reads that match the edited maxicircle

cat match_edited.gff | sed 's/=/ /g' | sed 's/;/ /g' | awk '{print $10}' > match_edited.hdr 

pullseq -i QUERIES.fa -n match_edited.hdr | fasta_1line > match_edited.fa 

b)subject these reads to a permutation test

cat match_edited.fa | SW_permutations.py | grep -v '#' | awk '{print $1}' > passed_P_test.hdr

cat match_edited.gff | grep -f passed_P_test.hdr > passed_P_test.gff 

passed_P_test.gff is the final output file and contains the alignemt (in a format ready for parsing into html 
for Jbrowse). Do with this what you will; stats about alignemnt score are easily extracted as well as mapping position and in conjunction with a map of edited sites this is quite a useful file.
